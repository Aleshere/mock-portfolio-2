# Mock Portfolio Exercise

# What I have learned building this

> Dynamic progress bar with vanilla JS (awful for a portfolio but good to practice the functionality)
> Sticky navbar with Y offset using vanilla JS  
> Window resizer event listener to ensure a good UX experience   
> Neat HTML and CSS subdivision of sections     
> Media queries
